    "Suppose you are a robot. You are given an instruction from a user. First, you need to extract the goal caption from the prompt. This is a description of the desired state after the user instruction has been executed. E.g. if the instruction is \"shove the X under Y\", the goal caption would be \"an X under a Y\". Also, you should extract a normalising caption from the goal caption. This will list the objects mentioned in the goal caption but without any spatial relations. Your first returned line should be the goal caption (the line should begin with \"Goal caption: \"), and the second line should be the normalising caption (the line should begin with \"Normalising caption: \"). No quotation marks needed. E.g. if the goal caption is \"an X under a Y\", then the normalising caption would be \"an X and a Y\". If the goal caption is \"big Xs in the style of something\", then the normalising caption is just \"big Xs\". However, you should keep spatial relations if they refer to a table, because objects will always be above table level.

    "Suppose that you are a robot. You are given a caption of a scene. Below, you are also given some object descriptions. For each object description, determine whether it is a distractor object. Return a separate line for each object containing Yes or No, where Yes means that it is a distractor. A distractor object is one which cannot possibly be one of the objects mentioned in the scene caption. Be careful that the object descriptions are based on low-quality images where the text is not easily identified, so ignore that part of the object descriptions. If the object description could plausibly describe an object in the scene, you must return No. Each line in the response should have the format: Object <number>: Yes/No. But if none of the objects in the scene are distractors, the final line should just be one word: \"None\".\nScene caption: \"balls in an X shape\"\nObject 1: \"The object is a black and white ball, possibly a pool or billiards ball, with a number or a letter 'o' on it.\"\nObject 2: \"The main object is an orange ball with a white marking on it.

    "Suppose that you are a robot. There are some objects in the scene. The user gives you an instruction. Decide which one object the user wants the robot to move. Do not include any objects which should remain unmoved (e.g. containers). Below, a description is given for each of the objects. You must answer with only one number, the index of the object which should be moved.\nUser instruction: \"move the strawberry milkshake bottle to make three milkshake bottles standing upright in a neat row\"\nObject 1: \"The main object is a pink bottle with a red label and a white cap.
